# iOS Interview Preparation
Curating all the resources I refer to for interview preparation. This is not an exhaustive list and you are free to add your suggestion to it. Thank you!

Note: I have only interviewed with a single company as of now. I researched a lot about iOS interviews in general, but my views may be biased, and may not be helpful for the dream company you are preparing for.

# Behavioral Questions

This YouTube channel [Dan Croitor](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw0uQHve23oMWgQcTTpgQsQ/videos) has almost all the material and resources you need for a behavioral round.

You can start with this video - [How to pass a behavioral interview
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JhWHRJ3tTE)

Another video you can refer to - [Behavioral Interviews for Software Engineers](https://youtu.be/zIJ1qRCPHUw)

## Free Resources  [Non-Affliation]

### Raywenderlich Swift Algorithm Club

It is a public repository that has algortihms and data structures in Swift, with explanations. You can find it here -> [Welcome to the Swift Algorithm Club!](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-algorithm-club)

### LeetCode
LeetCode is the best platform according to me for practicing these type of questions, especially if you want to code in Swift. The editor supports Swift 5.0.1 and I faced no problem with it. 

IF you have less time and an interview coming up, you can buy the subscription for a month, to get access to the solutions.

## Paid Resources [Non-Affliation]

### [Cracking the Coding Interview Book](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com)
It is a nice book. You can either do the questions from this book or go through LeetCode. One big advantage of this book was the dedicated solution with explanation. And hints to solve a question, just like an interviewer may give you one.

### [Raywenderlich Data Structures & Algorithms in Swift Book](https://store.raywenderlich.com/products/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-swift)
This is a more comprehensive book with detailed explanation of data structures and algorithms in Swift.

### [Raywenderlich Data Structures & Algorithms in Swift Course](https://www.raywenderlich.com/977854-data-structures-algorithms-in-swift)
Really nice explanation of the data structures and algorithms in Swift.
