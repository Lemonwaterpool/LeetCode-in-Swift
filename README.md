# iOS Interview Preparation
Curating all the resources I refer to for interview preparation. This is not an exhaustive list and you are free to add your suggestion to it. Thank you!

Note: I have only interviewed with a single company as of now. I researched a lot about iOS interviews in general, but my views may be biased, and may not be helpful for the dream company you are preparing for.

## Free Resources  [Non-Affliation]

### Raywenderlich Swift Algorithm Club

It is a public repository that has algortihms and data structures in Swift, with explanations. You can find it here -> [Welcome to the Swift Algorithm Club!](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-algorithm-club)

### LeetCode
LeetCode is the best platform according to me for practicing these type of questions, especially if you want to code in Swift. The editor supports Swift 5.0.1 and I faced no problem with it. 

IF you have less time and an interview coming up, you can buy the subscription for a month, to get access to the solutions.
